Batched data loading with tensorclasses
=======================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 8-32

In this tutorial we demonstrate how tensorclasses and memory-mapped
tensors can be used together to efficiently and transparently load data
from disk inside a model training pipeline.

The basic idea is that we pre-load the entire dataset into a
memory-mapped tensors, applying any non-random transformations before
saving to disk. This means that not only do we avoid performing repeated
computation each time we iterate through the data, we also are able to
efficiently load data from the memory-mapped tensor in batches, rather
than sequentially from the raw image files.

Using the combination of pre-processing, loading on a contiguous physical-memory
storage and on-device batched transformation, we obtain a 10x speedup in data-loading
over regular torch + torchvision pipelines.

We’ll use the same subset of imagenet used in `this transfer learning
tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html>`__,
though we also give results of our experiments running the same code on ImageNet.

.. note:: Download the data from
  `here <https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/hymenoptera_data.zip>`__
  and extract it. We assume in this tutorial that the extracted data is
  saved in the subdirectory ``data/``.

Transforms

First we define train and val transforms that will be applied to train and
val examples respectively. Note that there are random components in the
train transform to prevent overfitting to training data over multiple
epochs.

We’ll also create a dataset of the raw training data that simply resizes
the image to a common size and converts to tensor. We’ll use this to
load the data into memory-mapped tensors. The random transformations
need to be different each time we iterate through the data, so they
cannot be pre-computed. We also do not scale the data yet so that we can set the
``dtype`` of the memory-mapped array to ``uint8`` and save space.

Since we'll be loading our data in batches, we write a few custom transformations
that take advantage of this, and apply the transformations in a vectorized way.

First a transformation that can be used for normalization.

When each batch is loaded, we will scale it, then randomly crop and flip. The random
transformations cannot be pre-applied as they must differ each time we iterate over
the data. The scaling could be pre-applied in principle, but by waiting until we load
the data into RAM, we are able to set the dtype of the memory-mapped array to
``uint8``, a significant space saving over ``float32``.

Representing data with a TensorClass
------------------------------------
Tensorclasses are a good choice when the structure of your data is known
apriori. They are dataclasses that expose dedicated tensor methods over
their contents much like a ``TensorDict``.

As well as specifying the contents (in this case ``images`` and
``targets``) we can also encapsulate related logic as custom methods
when defining the class. Here we add a classmethod that takes a dataset
and creates a tensorclass containing the data by iterating over the
dataset. We create memory-mapped tensors to hold the data so that they
can be efficiently loaded in batches later.

DataLoaders
-----------

We can create dataloaders both from the ``torchvision``-provided
Datasets, as well as from our memory-mapped tensorclasses.

Since tensorclasses implement ``__len__`` and ``__getitem__`` (and also
``__getitems__``) we can use them like a map-style Dataset and create a
``DataLoader`` directly from them.

Since the TensorClass data will be loaded in batches, we need to specify how these
batches should be collated. For this we write the following helper class

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 261-281

.. code-block:: default



    class Collate(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, transform=None, device=None):

            self.device = device

        def __call__(self, x: ImageNetData):
            # move data to RAM
            out = x.apply(lambda x: x.as_tensor()).pin_memory()
            if self.device:
                # move data to gpu
                out = out.to(self.device)
            if self.transform:
                # apply transforms on gpu
                out.images = self.transform(out.images)

``DataLoader`` has support for multiple workers loading data in parallel. The
tensorclass dataloader will use just one worker, but load data in batches.

Note that under this approach our ``collate_fn`` is essentially just an ``nn.Module``,
making it transparent and easy to implement. But this approach also offers
flexibility, for example, if needed we could move the collation step into the training
loop by considering the ``Collate`` module as part of the model.

We can now compare how long it takes to iterate once over the data in
each case. The regular dataloader loads images one by one from disk,
applies the transform sequentially and then stacks the results

Results from ImageNet
---------------------

We repeated the above on full-size ImageNet data, running on an AWS EC2 instance with
32 cores and 1 A100 GPU. We compare against the regular ``DataLoader`` with different
numbers of workers. We found that our single-threaded TensorClass approach
out-performed the ``DataLoader`` even when we used a large number of workers.

This shows that much of the overhead is coming from i/o operations rather than the
transforms, and hence explains how the memory-mapped array helps us load data more
efficiently. Check out the `distributed example <https://github.com/pytorch-labs/tensordict/tree/main/benchmarks/distributed/dataloading.py>`__
for more context about the other results from these charts.

We can get even better performance with the TensorClass approach by using multiple
workers to load batches from the memory-mapped array, though this comes with some
added complexity. See `this example in our benchmarks
<https://github.com/pytorch-labs/tensordict/blob/main/benchmarks/distributed/dataloading.py>`__
for an example of how this could work.
